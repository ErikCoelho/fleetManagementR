# Fleet Manager

## Fleet management project built to help truck drivers manage their maintenance, supplies, trips, expenses, and more.

I noticed that some drivers, at least those I know, only write down this information on paper. This can result in lost data and make management difficult. Therefore, I created this software to make it easier.

## Take a look at how it works

This is the beta version. It's being improved.

## How to access
For now, the software is in closed beta testing. When I think it is ready, I will provide the link for access.

## Technologies
.Net 7 - Using MVC architecture. <br>
Angular 14 - Using Tailwind CSS for styling, which saves time compared to writing a lot of CSS.<br>
Azure - This is what I chose to deploy the application, implement CI/CD, and also learn how to work with logs.
